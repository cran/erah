\title{Alignment list}
\usage{
alignList(object, by.area = TRUE)

\S4method{alignList}{MetaboSet}(object, by.area = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A 'MetaboSet' S4 object containing the experiment data. The experiment has to be previously deconvolved, aligned and (optionally) identified.}

\item{by.area}{if TRUE (default), eRah outputs quantification by the area of the deconvolved chromatographic peak of each compound. If FALSE, eRah outputs the intensity of the deconvolved chromatographic peak.}
}
\value{
\code{alignList} returns a data frame object:
     \item{AlignID}{The unique Tag for found metabolite by eRah. Each metabolite found by eRah for a given experiment has an unique AlignID tag number.}
     \item{Factor}{the Factor tag name. Each metabolite has an unique 'Factor' name to enhance visual interpretation.}
     \item{tmean}{The mean compound retention time.}
     \item{FoundIn}{The number of samples in which the compound has been detected (the number of samples where the compound area is non-zero).}	
     \item{Quantification}{As many columns as samples and as many rows as metabolites, where each column name has the name of each sample.}
}
\description{
The list of aligned metabolites and their relative quantification for each sample in a given experiment
}
\details{
Returns an alignment table containing the list of aligned metabolites and their relative quantification for each sample in a given experiment.
