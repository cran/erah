Description: Automated compound deconvolution, alignment across samples, and identification of metabolites by spectral library matching in Gas Chromatography - Mass spectrometry (GC-MS) untargeted metabolomics. Outputs a table with compound names, matching scores and the integrated area of the compound for each sample. Package implementation is described in Domingo-Almenara et al. (2016) <doi:10.1021/acs.analchem.6b02927>.
